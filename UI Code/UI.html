            <p style="text-align: justify;">Embark on a data-driven journey as we explore patterns in Netflix's vast catalog, decipher the evolution of content types, and shed light on popular genres from various corners of the globe.

          <h2>Number of Titles Added to Netflix</h2>
          <p>The bubble chart, line graph, and area graph all highlight Netflix’s growth in adding shows and movies over time. These charts show that after the 1990s, there was a big jump in the number of titles Netflix offered, matching up with the popularity of streaming online. The bigger bubbles, rising line, and wider shaded areas in the graphs all point to how Netflix has been working hard to give viewers more choices, especially in recent years. This increase is likely because Netflix wants to meet market demand and technological advancements.</p>
